I am currently a post-doctoral research fellow at Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, advised by Professor [Ming Hu](http://individual.utoronto.ca/minghu/). Before this, I completed my Ph.D. at the Department of Industrial Systems Engineering and Management, National University of Singapore, where I was advised by Assistant Professor [Xiaobo Li](https://sites.google.com/site/lixiaobohome/home).
